        <p>Due to ongoing federally mandated safety improvements (<a href="http://www.panynj.gov/path/cbtc-ptc-video.html">Positive Train Control</a>), there will be  system wide service changes in effect throughout 2018, including 17 weekend  closures. For information about the 2018 weekend closures, <a href="http://www.panynj.gov/path/pdf/PATH-WTC-XCH-Closure-21x33-eng.pdf" target="_blank">click here</a>.</p>
        <p> To help riders stay on track  during this time, PATH will provide a free 2-Trip MetroCard for transfer to MTA  Subway connections. The 2-Trip MetroCards will be distributed by PATH employees  at World Trade Center Station ONLY from 11:59 p.m. Friday through 5 a.m. Monday  and <strong>must be obtained  before exiting the turnstiles at World Trade Center Station. </strong>These  MetroCards will only be valid during the weekend they are issued.</p>
        <p> Throughout these weekend tunnel  closures, please allow additional travel time.</p>
        <p> We thank you for your patience.</p>
