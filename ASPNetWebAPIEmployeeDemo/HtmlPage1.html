        <p>Due  to ongoing <a href="../path/cbtc-ptc-video.html">Positive Train Control (PTC)</a> testing,  weekend tunnel closures will be in effect through October 2018.</p>
        <p> To accommodate riders during this  time, PATH is providing a free 2-Trip MetroCard for uptown travel. The 2-Trip  MetroCards will be distributed by PATH employees at WTC Station from 11:59 p.m.  Friday through 5 a.m. Monday each weekend and <strong>must be obtained before exiting the turnstiles at WTC  Station. </strong>These MetroCards will only be valid during the weekend  they were issued. </p>
        <p> Throughout  these weekend tunnel closures, please allow additional travel time.</p>
        <p> We  thank you for your patience.</p>
